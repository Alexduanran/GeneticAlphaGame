# Pong-Genetic

### Pong-Genetic-V1

A genetic algorithm project specifically designed for Pong.

Supports tournament selection and gaussian mutation.

### Pong-Genetic-V2

A more general and compatable genetic algorithm framework.

Supports elitism, roulettte-wheel, and tournament selection. 

Supports simulated binary, uniform binary, and single-point binary crossover. 

Supports gaussian, random uniform, uniform with respect to best individual, exponential, and mmo mutation.
